## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

A social layer for your browsing data, Zerem enables users to securely track their browsing data and share a curated feed to existing social platforms for their subscribers, allowing individual to benefit from their digital data and users to follow what their favorite creators spend their time on the internet.

### Overview

**What is the aim for Zerem ?**
- As currently we live in digital space, we have interesting people do interesting things on internet i.e what they are browsing, watching, learning and we want to get to know what they are up to.

- Benefiting from the data you are generating, as we browse we generate data that companies sell, Zerem turns your data to curated post that user can subscribe and engage
- leverage existing social platforms such as X, farcaster etc. As the browsing data is converted into a structured post and encrypted and posted on existing social platforms on user's account. Only subscribers having the access can view the feed, hence the user benefits from the data generated from browsing activities.

**How it works ?**

Zerem consist of a browser extension that tracks user internet activities excluding private details i.e passwords and a provable claim that it only tracks activities of which the user allows to. This extension collects data and curate social media post by which subscribers will be able to view their subscribed individual daily digital activies.

The consumer side of the application is the extension will be also used to view the social media post as all the post posted by the extension will be encrypted and gibberish with post hook. The extension will decrypt the post only to subscribers. By this we ensure that we leverage existing social platform to access vast userbase and providing the experience only web3 can provde.
 
All user activities will be stored locally and to IPFS per user request and all the keys to encrypt and decrypt post will be shared peer to peer and stored locally. All consensus related data such as subscriptions records, proof of recording non sensitive data etc will be recorded and managed onchain.

**Why ?**

In digital space we consume contents from different individuals who we admire, look upto and learn from or even hate. But there is one generated content that is really interesting which is our daily internet activities, what we learn, search, prompt, browse, watch etc that may interest people who follow you. For instance to seeing what Gavin Wood researches on, learn from, his prompts, this will interested to people who want to know and even gain access to his other part of life. But all with his consent but everything is automated on collecting the information and sharing. Essentially is "tracking to earn".

And also we generate billions of data on the internet but we benefit less to none from them and as there are many platforms to upload and sell your data, that proves to be a tough proposition as many users do not even know what and how useful their data is, Zerem turns your data to a consentual post to which you get paid to subscribers to see your interesting internet activities.

And Zerem aims to actually being used that is why we are following where the users are, we are leveraging the existing big social platform to our platform to make sure we get existing users and newer users.

Zerem is a product whereby it showcases what web3 products should be as having new functionalities that make sense only in web3 but can be used by masses on the internet. And this is the reason why building on Polkadot make sense as we intend Zerem to leverage scaling per its needs using coretime and consensus related data to be managed by high security interopable soverign system.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is *not* or will *not* provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and clarify any limitations that might not be obvious


Things that shouldn’t be part of the application (see also our [FAQ](../docs/faq.md)):

- The (future) tokenomics of your project
- For non-infrastructure projects—deployment and hosting costs, maintenance or audits
- Business-oriented activities (marketing, business planning), events or outreach

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems i t tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
- What need(s) does your project meet?
- How did you identify these needs? Please provide evidence in the form of (scientific) articles, forum discussions, case studies, or raw data.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different? Please identify and assess any projects addressing the same need and explain how your project is distinct. Feel free to include applicable research data, statistics, or metrics.
  - If not, please indicate why such a project might not have been possible, successful, or attempted. 
- Are there any projects similar to yours in related ecosystems?

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/Support%20Docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe *the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible*, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We *recommend* that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

> [!CAUTION]
> If any of your deliverables are based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish *under the terms of the license* of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Projects that submit other people's work without proper attribution will be immediately terminated.**
